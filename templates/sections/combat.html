      <h2>Combat Rules</h2>
      <p>Combat is resolved in structured combat rounds, each representing approximately five seconds of in-world time. During a round, characters act in descending order of Initiative until all participants have spent their available Action Points (AP).</p>
      
      <h3>Action Points</h3>
      <p>Each character begins the combat round with 4 Action Points (AP). This might be raised trough cyberware or other effects. Action Points are spent to perform actions such as attacking, moving, or taking aim. Some actions require multiple points to complete, while others cost only one. If an action cost 4 AP it always uses the entire round, no matter how many AP the character actually has. Any unspent Action Points can be reserved for defensive reactions. Unused points do not carry over into the next round.</p>
      
      <h3>Initiative</h3>
      <p>At the start of each combat round, every participant may choose to spend Action Points to roll for Initiative. For each Action Point spent, roll 1d6 and add the total to the character’s Initiative Attribute (Reaction + Intuition). Characters act in descending Initiative order.  Action Points spent for Initiative reduce the number of points available for actions that round.</p>
      
      <h3>Attacks and Defense</h3>
      <p>An attack is resolved through an opposed roll between the attacker and the defender:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> Rolls the appropriate Attack Dice Pool plus any modifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Defender:</strong> Rolls their Defense Pool = Agility + Intuition, plus any modifiers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the defender’s hits ≥ attacker’s hits, the attack fails and no damage is inflicted. If the attacker scores more hits, the attack succeeds — the number of <strong>net hits</strong> (attacker hits minus defender hits) increases the final damage.</p>
      
      <h3>Modifiers to Defense</h3>

            <td>+Dodge Skill Rating (costs 1 AP)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Damage Resolution</h3>
      <p>Successful attacks inflict Damage = Weapon Damage + Net Hits. Before applying damage, reduce its effectiveness according to the defender’s Armor Rating and the weapon’s Penetration Value. Each point of Armor converts one point of Physical Damage into Stun Damage, unless negated by penetration. Afterward, the victim chooses how to distribute the total damage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical Damage</strong> reduces the target’s Physical Attributes (Stamina, Strength, Agility, Reaction) by the total damage received.</li>
        <li><strong>Stun Damage</strong> reduces the target’s Mental Attributes (Intuition, Logic, Composure) by the total damage received.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any attribute is reduced to 0, the character becomes incapacitated or unconscious, depending on the type of damage.</p>

    <div id="content-combat-actions" class="content-block">
      <h2>Combat Actions</h2>
      <p>During a combat round, characters may perform actions by spending Action Points (AP). Each character begins the round with 4 AP, minus any spent on the Initiative roll. Actions can be taken in any order during the character’s turn, provided the total Action Point cost does not exceed the remaining AP. Unused Action Points may be reserved for defensive reactions (such as Dodge) or delayed actions later in the round, but must be spent before the round ends.</p>

      <h3>Action Timing and Reactions</h3>

    <div id="content-blast-attacks" class="content-block">
      <h2>Blast Attacks</h2>
      <p>Attacks caused by explosive weapons such as grenades, rockets, or explosive rounds inflict Blast Damage instead of conventional weapon damage. Blast Damage represents both the destructive power and area of effect of an explosion.</p>

      <h3>Resolving a Blast Attack</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Determine the Center of Impact:</strong> Establish the point of detonation. Any character or object within the Blast Radius (measured in meters) is affected.</li>
        <li><strong>Attack Roll</strong>The Attacker rolls a normal heavy wepaons attack roll with the usual modifiers. </li>
        <li><strong>Defense Roll:</strong> Each affected target rolls a halved Defense Pool (Agility + Intuition) / 2, rounded up. Modifiers such as cover, prone position, or environmental barriers may apply at the GM’s discretion.</li>
        <li><strong>Damage Resolution:</strong> A Blast weapon’s damage value determines three properties:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Damage:</strong> The number of damage points inflicted.</li>
            <li><strong>Penetration:</strong> The number of armor points ignored.</li>
            <li><strong>Radius (m):</strong> The distance in meters from the blast center affected by the explosion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, a grenade with Blast = 4 deals 4 damage, ignores 4 points of armor, and affects all targets within 4 meters of the detonation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Damage Application:</strong> Roll for the explosion as normal. Apply Blast Damage + Net Hits to each affected target after comparing the attacker’s roll to each defender’s halved Defense Pool. Armor converts Physical to Stun Damage as usual, reduced by the attack’s penetration.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Secondary Effects</h3>
      <p>Explosions may also cause secondary effects such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Knockdown or Disorientation: On top of the physical damage, a blast attack then deals an amount of additional Stun damage equal to its blast value</li>
        <li>Structural Damage: Objects and cover may be destroyed or reduced in effectiveness within the Blast Radius.</li>
        <li>Chain Reactions: Explosives or fuel sources caught in the radius may detonate.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="content-full-auto" class="content-block">
      <h2>Full Auto Attacks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Every weapon with the max_auto feature can fire a number bullets equal to twice the 
          max_auto value in one or more salvoes using 3 action points. The Attacker adds the 
          auto_bonus of his weapon and his character to the dice pool. He can attack two different
          targets if reasonably close together by splitting his successes on the attack roll between them.
          An Attack on multiple targets must be declared before the attack roll. You cannot use any zoom bonus when firing full_auto</li>
        <li>The maximum bonus is is given by the weapon as max_auto_value. The number of bullets fired is twice that number</li>
        <li>If not enough bullets are left the maximum bonus is halve the fired bullets.</li>

    <h3>Range Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Range Categories:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Range 0:</strong> Unarmed combat.</li>
                <li><strong>Range 1:</strong> Small weapons (Knives, Hatchets) OR Long weapons in cramped spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Range 2:</strong> Long weapons (Swords, Axes) with sufficient space.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Advantage:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When two characters fight, compare their Range.</li>
                <li>The character with the <strong>lower Range</strong> subtracts the difference from their total successes on <strong>every roll</strong> (Attack or Defense).</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Range 2 vs. Range 0 results in a penalty of -2 successes for the Unarmed fighter.</li>
