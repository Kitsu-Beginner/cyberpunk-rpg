    <h2>Timeline of Events (2030–2050): The Fall and the Flare</h2>
    
    <h2 id="timeline-2030s">2030s: The Great Collapse and Cybernetic Dawn</h2>
    <p>Decades of escalating political and social polarization led to the gradual paralysis of core state institutions. Governance eroded as administrative oversight bodies quickly hollowed out, leaving only basic administrative functions alive</p>
    
    <div class="rules-highlight-block">
        <h4>The Megacorporations Emerge</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversight of global corporate cartels was among the first casualties. Major companies began an aggressive, unchecked campaign of mergers, resulting in the formation of the first true <strong>megacorporations</strong>—vast, vertically integrated entities that operated with the economic scope and military-level authority once reserved exclusively for nation-states.</li>
            <li>Society splintered, protected corporate enclaves with their own administration and rules were built. The periphery of these enclaves is made of self gouverned states and cities. The federal gouvernment still exist but mostly stays out of regional affairs. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Technological Acceleration & The Quantum Crisis</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The emergence of the first <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> triggered an unprecedented wave of technological progress, yet was met with widespread social rejection.</li>
        <li>Megacorporations made full use of AGI for research, driving staggering advances in materials science, biotechnology, and microelectronics.</li>
        <li>The first rudimentary <strong>cybernetic implants</strong> were successfully developed, allowing early adopters to surpass basic biological limits, gaining enhanced vision, strength, and reflexes.</li>
        <li>The advent of quantum computing caused a data security crisis: Conventional encryption standards became obsolete overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless communication was deemed inherently unsafe</strong>, forcing information security to rely on wired systems and physical couriers for critical data transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2040s: Cyberware, magic and private armies</h2>
    
    <p>Technological progress continued its exponential climb, creating conglomerates that synthesized AGI-driven R&D, biotech, and hardware manufacturing.</p>
    
    <div class="rules-highlight-block">
        <h4>Mass-Market Cybernetics & Military Defection</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>These conglomerates introduced the first <strong>mass-market cyberware</strong>: cybernetic eyes, synthetic muscles, subdermal armor, and integrated biomonitors.</li>
            <li>As governments crumbled, national militaries suffered mass disillusionment. Displaced soldiers and highly trained officers defected to private security divisions, forming powerful <strong>corporate armies</strong>.</li>
            <li>Covert operations between corporate entities became commonplace, often employing independent contractors—<strong>runners or freelancers</strong>—to obscure direct corporate involvement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>The Discovery of Magic (Thaumaturgy)</h3>
    <p>A scientific breakthrough led to the discovery of a process allowing human consciousness to manipulate physical reality directly, giving birth to **Thaumaturgy** (magic).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Megacorporations established training academies, transforming individuals capable of manifesting these effects (Casters or Magi) into critical strategic assets.</li>
        <li>Instruction was rigorously scientific, organized into schools based on observable physical principles: Energy, Matter, and Spacetime.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> A critical incompatibility was discovered: cybernetic implants severely interfered with the ability to channel magical effects. No solution has yet been found to reconcile magic with heavy augmentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2050s: The Corporate Hegemony</h2>
    
    <p>True authority rests entirely with the megacorporations that control all infrastructure, data, and production. Governments retained only symbolic functions.</p>

    <h3>The Corporate Feudal System</h3>
    <p>Global society stabilized into a stark corporate-feudal system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enclaves:</strong> Pristine, luxurious megacorp-owned cities serving as centers of research and elite habitation.</li>
        <li><strong>Peripheries:</strong> Vast, self gouverned stretches of urban sprawl maintained by local administrations and decentralized economies.</li>
        <li>The concept of digital citizenship became the legal reality: an individual's identity, health, and access rights were inseparable from their corporate server record.</li>
    </ul>
