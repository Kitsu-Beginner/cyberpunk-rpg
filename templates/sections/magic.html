      <h2>Magic Rules</h2>
      
      <h3>Magic</h3>
      <p>Magic represents the manipulation of physical and metaphysical forces through direct mental control. It is not mystical, but a form of advanced psionic resonance, allowing trained individuals—called Casters—to alter energy, matter, and spacetime through mental focus and neural discipline. Each act of magic imposes strain on the caster’s biological and cognitive systems, known as Drain.</p>
      
      <h3>Schools of Magic</h3>
      <p>All spells belong to one of three Schools of Magic, each governed by a separate skill and attribute pair. These define both the method and scope of manipulation available to the caster.</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Each specialization represents a narrower focus within a School. Specializations grant +2 dice when directly applicable to the spell being cast.</p>

      <h3>Casting a Spell</h3>
      <p>Casting a spell requires the expenditure of Action Points (AP) as defined in the spell’s description. Spell actions range from 1–4 AP, depending on their complexity and duration.</p>
      <p><strong>Dice Pool = (Linked Attributes / 2, rounded up) + Relevant Magic Skill + Modifiers</strong></p>
      <p>Each roll of 5–6 counts as one success (hit).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Combat Spells:</strong> Resolved as an opposed roll against the target’s Defense Pool (Agility + Intuition), identical to a ranged attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Area Spells:</strong> Affect all targets within the specified radius; each defender rolls halved Defense Pool to resist.</li>
        <li><strong>Utility Spells:</strong> Require a fixed number of hits to succeed, determined by the GM or the spell’s description.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Range, area of effect, and casting conditions are defined individually for each spell.</p>

      <h3>Drain Damage</h3>
      <p>Every spell has a Drain Dice value listed in its description. Immediately after casting a spell (success or failure), the caster rolls the listed number of Drain Dice (d6). Each result of 5–6 inflicts 1 point of Physical Damage to the caster. Humanity acts as protection against Drain: Each point of Humanity converts 1 point of Physical Damage from Drain into Stun Damage instead. Drain cannot be resisted or avoided by armor, cyberware, or defensive rolls.</p>

      <h3>Damage from Magic</h3>
      <p>If a spell inflicts damage (such as IceBullet or Plasma Arc), calculate final damage as: Spell Damage + Net Hits, modified by any penetration or armor effects stated in the spell’s description. All normal damage application rules apply—Physical Damage reduces physical attributes, and Stun Damage reduces mental attributes.</p>
      
      <h3>Action Timing and Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A caster may perform multiple spells per round as long as sufficient Action Points remain.</li>
        <li>Casting another spell while suffering from Stun penalties or reduced attributes increases the risk of incapacitation through Drain.</li>
        <li>Cyberware or implants that directly amplify or stabilize magic use are extremely rare and often illegal.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Plasmalance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Thermodynamics)</li>

        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 150m</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> 2 Dice per Level</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster heats the molecules of the air in front of him to a plasma and shoots it through an electromagnetic tunnel at a target.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is an Opposed Roll. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). The target resists with their Defense Pool (Agility + Intuition).</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> This spell's power scales with its Level (which the caster must choose before casting). The spell has a Base Damage of 1 and a Penetration of 2 for every Level it is cast at.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Damage:</strong> The total damage inflicted is (Base Damage) + (Net Hits).</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>IceBullet Storm</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Thermodynamics)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Combat (Multitarget)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 3 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 50m </li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> 5 Dice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Caster freezes wapervapor all around him and shoots a storm of bullets at one or multiple targets.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is an Opposed Roll. The caster builds their dice pool and adds a +4 dice bonus for the "full auto" nature of the spell: Dice Pool = [Energy Skill + (Intuition + Com composure) / 2] + 4 Dice</li>
        <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The target resists with their Defense Pool (Agility + Intuition).</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> If the caster wins, the spell inflicts 2 + Net Hits as Physical Damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Damage Type:</strong> Physical</li>
        <li><strong>Penetration:</strong> 3</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Plasmaball</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Thermodynamics)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Combat (Blast / AOE)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 50m (Detonation Point)</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (4 Dice per Level)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster heats a small Spot in within 50 meters to extreme temperetures, which then combusts into a wave of plasmaheated Gas.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> The caster must choose the Level of the spell (e.g., Level 1, 2, 3...) before casting. This determines the spell's power and its Drain.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> The caster rolls 4 Drain Dice per Level of the spell (e.g., a Level 3 Plasmaball has a Drain of 12 Dice).</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> The spell has a Base Damage of 1, a Penetration of 1, and a Blast Radius of 1 meter per Level. (Example: A Level 3 Plasmaball deals 3 Damage, 3 Penetration, and has a 3m Radius).</li>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is an Opposed Roll against all targets within the Blast Radius. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). Each target resists individually with their Defense Pool / 2 (rounded down), as per the "Blast Attacks" rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Damage:</strong> Each target that fails to defend takes (Base Damage) + (Caster's Net Hits) as Physical Damage (Type: Heat).</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>SonicBoom</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Thermodynamics)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Combat (Blast / AOE)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 3 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 50m (Detonation Point)</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (2 Dice per Level)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster speeds up molecules to create a sonic boom at a point within 50 metres.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> The caster must choose the Level of the spell (e.g., Level 1, 2, 3...) before casting. This determines the spell's power and its Drain.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> The caster rolls 2 Drain Dice per Level of the spell (e.g., a Level 3 SonicBoom has a Drain of 6 Dice).</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> The spell has a Base Damage of 1 and a Blast Radius of 1 meter per Level. (Example: A Level 3 SonicBoom deals 3 Base Damage and has a 3m Radius).</li>
        <li><strong>Damage Type:</strong> This spell inflicts Stun Damage. This damage reduces the target's Mental Attributes (Intuition, Logic, Composure).</li>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is an Opposed Roll against all targets within the Blast Radius. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). Each target resists individually with their Defense Pool / 2 (rounded down), as per the "Blast Attacks" rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Damage:</strong> Each target that fails to defend takes (Base Damage) + (Caster's Net Hits) as Stun Damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Raise or Lower Temperature</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Thermodynamics)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Utility</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (1 Die per kg of target)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster lowers or raises the temperature of an object or fluid through direct thermal manipulation.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). This is a standard test; the number of hits determines the magnitude of the effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Each hit (5 or 6) allows the caster to raise or lower the temperature of the target object/fluid by 100 degrees Celsius. The target must be a single contiguous object or volume of fluid that the caster is touching.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> The Drain for this spell is determined by the mass of the target. The caster rolls 1 Drain Die per kilogram (kg) of the object/fluid being affected. (Note: This Drain can be extreme for large objects, making it most effective on smaller items, or requiring high Humanity to resist.)</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Lightning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Electromagnetism)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Combat (Single Target + AOE)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 150m</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> 10 Dice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster launches a lightning bolt by creating a point of extreme electrical potential difference near a target.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is an Opposed Roll. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). The primary target resists with their full Defense Pool (Agility + Intuition).</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Target Effect:</strong> The spell has a Base Damage of 0. Each Net Hit from the Opposed Roll inflicts 2 Physical Damage (Type: Electricity).</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary AOE Effect:</strong> After the primary target is hit, an electrical blast radiates outwards. All characters (including the primary target) within a 5-meter radius must resist a secondary effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Defense:</strong> All targets in the radius (except the primary) make an Opposed Roll with their Defense Pool / 2 (rounded down, per "Blast Attacks" rule) against the caster's original hits.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Damage:</strong> The total Physical Damage inflicted on the primary target is halved (rounded up) and dealt as Stun Damage to all characters in the radius who failed their defense roll.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Barrier</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Electromagnetism)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Utility (Barrier / AOE)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 50m (Caster creates barrier at a point in line of sight)</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (1 Die per square metre)</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> Requires Concentration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster creates a wall or bubble of electromagnetic resistance that acts like a solid but transparent barrier. The barrier cannot be moved once cast.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is a Standard Test. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). The number of hits determines the strength of the barrier.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> The spell creates a static, transparent barrier. The barrier has an Armor Rating (AR) equal to the number of hits rolled. All attacks passing through the barrier are reduced by this AR. The barrier is solid and cannot be passed through by physical characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> The Drain is 1 Die per square meter of the barrier's surface (e.g., a 2x2m wall would be 4 Drain Dice).</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> The caster must concentrate to maintain the spell. </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Shieldbubble</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Electromagnetism)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Utility (Barrier / Self)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Self</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (2 Dice per cubic meter)</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> Requires Concentration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster creates a moving field of electromagnetic resistance that forms a shield or bubble, moving freely with the caster.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is a Standard Test. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). The number of hits determines the strength of the shield.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> The spell creates a mobile, transparent barrier around the caster. The barrier has an Armor Rating (AR) equal to the number of hits rolled, which applies to all attacks against the caster.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> The Drain is 2 Dice per cubic meter of the barrier's volume (e.g., a 2m bubble for all-around protection would be 8 Drain Dice).</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> The caster must concentrate to maintain the spell.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Laser</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Light/Radiation)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Combat (Single Target)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 2 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> 150m (Assumed Line of Sight)</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> 10 Dice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Caster shoots a beam of red laser out of his eyes at a single target.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is an Opposed Roll. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + ComL composure) / 2 (rounded up). The target resists with their Defense Pool (Agility + Intuition).</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> If the caster wins, the spell inflicts 1 + Net Hits as Physical Damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Damage Type:</strong> Physical (Heat)</li>
        <li><strong>Penetration:</strong> 4 (This attack ignores 4 points of the target's Armor Rating).</li>
        <li><strong>Special Rule (Called Shot):</strong> The caster may declare they are targeting a specific body part (e.g., arm, leg, head). This imposes a -3 dice penalty on the Casting Test.
          <ul>
            <li>If the attack hits, the target's armor only applies if that specific part is covered.</li>
            <li>The Physical Damage must be applied to the attribute corresponding to the part hit (e.g., Agility for legs, Stamina for torso etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Cloaking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Energy (Light/Radiation)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Utility (Self)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Self</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (3 Dice per Level)</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> Requires Concentration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You bend and distort the light that reflects off your body to become invisible.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> The caster must choose the Level of the spell (e.g., Level 1, 2, 3...) before casting. This determines the spell's power and its Drain.</li>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is a Standard Test. The caster rolls their Energy Skill + (Intuition + Composure) / 2 (rounded up). The number of hits rolled must be greater than or equal to the spell's chosen Level for the spell to succeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> If successful, the caster becomes invisible. Any character using vision to track or target the caster treats their action as +1 Difficulty Level per Level of the spell. (Example: A 'Standard' (2 hits) Perception test to spot a caster with a Level 2 Cloak would become a 'Very Hard' (4 hits) test).</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> The caster rolls 3 Drain Dice per Level of the spell.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> The caster must concentrate to maintain the spell. (This likely costs 1 AP per round or limits other actions, per GM discretion).</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Heal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Material (Organic)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Utility (Healing)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (3 Dice per point healed)</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> Variable (Requires Concentration)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The caster lays their hands on the target and initiates a psionic command over their biology, forcing an explosive, localized cellular regeneration. Wounds are sealed and tissue is knit together not by natural healing, but by direct, molecular-level manipulation of the target's own biomatter.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is a Standard Test. The caster rolls their dice pool to determine the amount of healing.</li>
        <li><strong>Dice Pool:</strong> Material Magic Skill + (Intuition + Logic) / 2 (rounded up) + Target's Humanity Score.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> The number of hits (5s or 6s) equals the total points of Physical Damage healed. The target regains this many points to their Physical Attributes (Stamina, Strength, Agility, or Reaction), distributed as they choose.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> This spell is exceptionally taxing. The caster must roll 3 Drain Dice for every point of Physical Damage healed. (Example: Healing 3 points of damage costs 9 Drain Dice).</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> The caster must maintain concentration for a number of Combat Rounds equal to the points healed. If the caster's concentration is broken (e.g., by taking damage or performing another action), the spell ends immediately.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Timebubble</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School:</strong> Gravity (Time)</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Utility (Self)</li>
        <li><strong>Action Cost:</strong> 4 AP</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Self</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Variable (5 + (5 * Level)) Dice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The caster uses extreme gravitational forces to bend the space time around him to act faster relative to subjects outside the bubble. Clocks would show a diferent time depending if inside or outside the bubble. To an outside observer, they become a blur of motion, a glitch in reality. To the caster, the world slows to a crawl, allowing them to think and act multiple times between the ticks of a clock.</p>
      <h4>Mechanics:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> The caster must choose the Level of the spell (e.g., Level 1, 2, 3...) before casting. This determines the spell's power and its Drain.</li>
        <li><strong>Casting Test:</strong> This is a Standard Test. The caster rolls their Gravity Magic Skill + (Composure + Logic) / 2 (rounded up). The number of hits rolled must be greater than or equal to the spell's chosen Level for the spell to succeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect:</strong> If successful, the caster immediately gains +1 Initiative and +1 Action Point per Level of the spell. These new AP are available for use in the current Combat Round.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain:</strong> This spell is extremely dangerous. The caster must roll 5 + (5 * Level) Drain Dice. (Example: A Level 1 Timebubble costs 10 Drain Dice. A Level 3 Timebubble costs 20 Drain Dice).</li>
        <li><strong>Sustain:</strong> The caster must maintain concentration for the duration of the spell</li>
      </ul>
